## Where I came from?
I was a Windows user since I remember. I loved all the Microsoft products, even their  hardware, like Surface... until I met Linux when I joined Altoros. With Linux I started to see a new world, open source applications, a community, people sharing their knowledge, their own code, developers improving software made by other developers. So, I started to think: “Microsoft is very good, but maybe if they would start to share their code or listening their users in a different way, they could have much better products”.

## First steps with IDEs
At the University, studying Computer Science, the professors recommended Eclipse as the perfect IDE, with so many features: auto-completion, references to the methods definition, linters and so on. It was so slow and so interested in consuming your RAM! Then I heard about Sublime Text, it was love at first sight: fast, simple, basic and powerful at the same time, with a lot of plugins to extend its functionality.

## When I met VS Code
A couple of weeks ago, a client told us that they will start to use TypeScript and he asked me to take a look to *Visual Studio Code Editor* because someone recommended him as a good tool to code using TypeScript.

To be honest, my first thought was: "Visual Studio? Microsoft? I don't think so...", but well... *client is always right*, heh?

So I went to Google and typed **Visual Studio Code** and entered here: https://code.visualstudio.com/. First things I saw in his web: multi-platform, more than 10 thousands stars on GitHub (GitHub? Nice!) and Extensions. Very good start! So I went to the GitHub project and the title said: "Visual Studio Code - Open Source", then I saw the issues, how organized they were... I couldn't wait any longer, *let's install this thing!*

You just have to download a file, extract it and you're ready to go, easy.

## What I miss of Sublime on VS Code?

*Short answer: nothing*. I found them pretty similar, both of them are fast, minimalistic, with plugins to extend its functionality. Even *most of the shortcuts are the same*.

It’s true, VS Code doesn’t have many plugins as Sublime Text, but it has the ones I need.

## VS Code: The good parts

The thing I love most of VS Code is the integration with GIT and the Debug mode, both out-of-the-box. But you can also find:

- Linter for JS, CSS, LESS, SASS and Java
- Language Colorization (syntax highlighting) for a lot of languages
- Markdown preview (live). I'm using it to write this Post.
- Developer Tools (because it's developed using [Electron Framework](http://electron.atom.io/))
- A way to create your own snippets
- User and Workspace settings
- Themes
- Tasks: VS Code auto detects gulp, grunt and jake tasks from your project files and it can run them if you want.
- Extensions and Extension Manager (Package Control for Sublime Text users)

### Extensions

VS Code is just starting, but you already have several extensions to use. I just installed 2, so far:
- **semistandard**, to validate my JS code (the linter included by Code it wasn't enough)
- **Slack Integration**, to share code (entire files o just pieces) on Slack channels

You'll see 6 categories on the [MarketPlace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/#VSCode):
- Debuggers
- Languages
- Linters
- Snippets
- Themes
- Other

Or you can [create your own](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/overview).

## Bottom line
I'm glad that Microsoft is back again! Developing their products with a better and a completely new approach, sharing its knowledge with the developers community and giving them a very good product, but most of all [listening to its users](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) and implementing new features that they were requesting.

I think you should give it an opportunity, it won't disappoint you.
